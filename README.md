Java Page Flipping Applet Demo
==============================

A [demo applet](http://rawgit.com/noelbk/pageapplet/master/html/index.html) that lets you drag a magazine page.


The mostinteresting part of this is the derivation of a
[transformation
matrix](src/com/burtonkrahn/pageapplet/scene/Planed.java) that
reflects points across a plane defined halfway along the line for
where the drag started to the current mouse position.
